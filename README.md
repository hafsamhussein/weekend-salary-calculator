## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
This project was a Salary Calculator Application and the main point of it is to efficiently track and calculate the monthly costs of a list of employees based on their annual salaries. The user is able to input employee information, sucg as first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary. When all of this is inputted, the user submits and this displays the total monthly cost of all emplyees. If the total exceepts $20,000, it alerts and highlits it red. The user is also able to delete individual employee entries when needed. 

Some of the problems I solved were
 #1. tracking and calculating the monthly cost based on employees annual salaries

 #2. User friendly way of inputting employee details

 #3. Realtime feed back if cost is over the amount needed
 
 #4. A way to see all added employees in a list

 #5. Figuring out a way to delete employees
